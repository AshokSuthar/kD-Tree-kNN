# kdTree_kNN
Comparing runtime and performance of k Nearest Neighbor algorithm based on different kdTree implementations.

'kd_tree.py' implementation uses normal method of splitting based on a dimension at each level, Whereas other 'magnitude_kdTree.py' considers points as a vector and uses it magnitude to split upon accross all levels.
